        <h2> Booking details</h2>
        <p>Booking a driving school is a simple process that helps you start learning how to drive safely and confidently. First, research a few local driving schools in your area. You can do this by searching online, asking friends or family for recommendations, or checking reviews. Make sure the school is licensed and has good instructors.

Next, visit the website of the driving school you choose or call them directly. Most schools have websites where you can find information about the courses they offer, prices, and schedules. Look for beginner courses if you are new to driving. Also, check if they offer automatic or manual car lessons, depending on what you want to learn.

Once you decide, fill out the booking form online or give them your details over the phone. You may need to provide your name, age, contact information, and preferred time slots. Some schools ask for a learner’s permit or ID before starting lessons.

After booking, you may need to pay a deposit or the full fee in advance. The school will then confirm your schedule and assign an instructor. They will also tell you what to bring on your first day, like your learner’s permit and any paperwork.

Finally, show up on time for your lesson, listen to your instructor, and practice regularly. Booking a driving school is the first step toward becoming a confident and responsible driver. With the right school, learning to drive can be a fun and rewarding experience.</p>
